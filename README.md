# Emotion-Detection
## Job Assignment System by Real-time Emotion Detection
Emotion is the essential role of facial expression and it could provide a lot of information for communication. Emotion recognition is a active research field in the area of computer vision and pattern recognition while it could provide many important functions like monitoring the status of the driver, supervising the candidates during the exam. The individual facial emotion recognition system has been developed powerfully while the multiple facial emotion recognition system and real-time emotion recognition system needed to be improved especially the accuracy of various emotions. In this project, I prepare to develop the system to detect the emotion in the image, video and real-time scenario.

In the company, job assignment is always a problem for the supervisor. How to assign the job to improve the overall efficiency and how to assign the job to specific staff in specific time period of specific department. So I develop the job assignment system to improve the overall working efficiency by real time emotion detection
